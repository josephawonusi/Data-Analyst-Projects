## Project 1: Import NBA API Data and Clean with Python
The project involves data ingestion from the NBA API using the 'requests' and 'pandas' libraries to retrieve information about NBA players and teams. Additionally, data is scraped from Wikipedia using 'BeautifulSoup' to gather details on the last 10 NBA champions.
